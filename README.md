# uuMusic

## Why is uu?
All the app's data comes from QQ Music. The difference between the two is that UU is completely free.
The difference between U and Q is that U has one less /k/ sound. In Chinese, /k/ is pronounced as "氪" (krypton).

## Special Thanks
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the following individuals and organizations for their support and contributions:
